                    <h4>Kind Words About Our Care</h4>
                    <p>“Raquel has been looking after my 92 year old mother as a live-in carer. She is bubbly, friendly and kind and mum loves her because she can cook great food! As well as all mum’s personal care, she cleans the house and does the shopping and takes mum out and about, and also brings her to my house for lunch. Raquel will sit with mum in the evenings and keep her company. Mum is happy when Raquel is caring for her which is exactly what we needed in a carer.”</p>
